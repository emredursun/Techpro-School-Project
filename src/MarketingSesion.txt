        Why should we hire you?
        I made a lot of searches about your company and I see that you are attributing a great importance to your clients which means that you also take care of your employees well.
        I think these qualities broght me to the same page and I applied for you. So I would like to share my experience in automation, and business with my strong communication and contributions with my skills.
        I think this would be a win-win story

        company aproach to employees should be described
        your technical, business experience share
        how you will contribute also with your communication and collaboration in team
        communication and collaboration
        technical and business experience
        search about the job description
        search about company
        search also about the people who will interview you
        What is your experience with API?
        I do use Postman for Manual testing of API and Rest Assured Library for automation.
        We use swagger document for API testing
        we do End to End testing using
        we are using Endpoints to make certain requests
        such as Get, POST, PUT and DELETE
        we manage and apply certain authentication and authorisations to manipulate the data securely and we use Bearer Token for authentication
        we are validating the data using Object Mapper and GSON for serialization(Java to JSON) and deserialization(JSON to Java)
        we use pojo classes and maps to manipulate the data and validate them with assertions and HemchrestMatchers to match the status codes and the body
        Can you tell us any exceptions you faced with api?
        I face mismatch exception when doing deserialization to set the data to pojo classes
        If you are given limited test data, how would you validate them?
        I can use JSONIGNOREPROPERTIES to match the limited data
        base url + path params + query params
